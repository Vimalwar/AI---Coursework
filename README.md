# AI-Coursework

In this course project, we have to recreate a result of a research paper related to Artifical Intelligence.

Our research project focuses on reconstructing mesh representations from low-resolution point clouds, obtained from sensors like LiDAR, Kinect etc. Current learning-based mesh generative methods struggle with fine-grained details and generalization to new object categories due to their reliance on shape embeddings at the whole-object level. In contrast, the method proposed in this paper maximizes the utilization of the input point cloud by incorporating connectivity information directly onto existing points, predicting which triplets of points should form faces. They introduce a novel surrogate of local connectivity, computed through intrinsic/extrinsic metrics and learned using a deep point cloud network.
